## 2021-09-02 - Check for error on connect and return false if the connection failed

**Commit**: [c4d43765217a67f8394bf946336ce55a13aef31a](https://github.com/pbolduc/AsyncTCP/commit/c4d43765217a67f8394bf946336ce55a13aef31a)

Original fix, see [BlueAndi/AsyncTCP](https://github.com/BlueAndi/AsyncTCP/commit/ce2e7949d9694a8b10379c39d101ce55c2a8a287)'s commit

* _tcp_connect can return ESP_OK or an error. This change will return false if the _tcp_connect is not successful. Applications could wait for a long time if they believe the connection was successful.

## 2021-08-31 - Fix memory leak and potential crash on low memory

**Commit**: [c5379e598e2c24a703fd00978ad78e1da9925888](https://github.com/pbolduc/AsyncTCP/commit/c5379e598e2c24a703fd00978ad78e1da9925888)

* Memory Leak - In the case the TCP message queue is full, in `_remove_events_with_arg`, if a dequeued packet cannot be requeued, it needs to be freed to prevent memory leak.
* Crash on low memory - various handlers attempt to allocate a `lwip_event_packet_t` object to be added to the queue. Added checks to see if malloc failed to avoid crash with LoadProhibited error.

## 2021-08-19 - Make watchdog config independent of running core

**Commit**: [4cd288686d11e2e7f74782cac0d40b6494c97033](https://github.com/pbolduc/AsyncTCP/commit/4cd288686d11e2e7f74782cac0d40b6494c97033)

Define `CONFIG_ASYNC_TCP_USE_WDT=0` to disable the WDT usage. WDT adds 30-200us per event.
